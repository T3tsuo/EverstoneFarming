## Where to start running the code:
Start one step UP inside of Iron Island.
As soon as you run the code, make sure you click on the game

## Pokemon Team Composition:
* First pokemon has frisk ability.
* Second pokemon (Quagsire) has thief in first slot and surf in second slot.
* Pokemon with sweet scent must be in your party.

## Rest of the team suggestion:
* Best if as many pokemons as you can uses exp. shares to clear battle logs quicker
by gaining exp so program doesn't read old battle logs.
    * Using Kricketot at least level 17 is ideal because it stop learning new moves.

## Key Slots:
* Bike in 1st key slot.
* Sweet scent in fourth key slot.
* Fly in 5th key slot.

## Game Configuration:
* Make battle log as minimized as possible and lock the chat.
* Best if battle log is not empty (at least 1 random encounter).
* Set window size: 765 x 534 (2 battle logs).
    * You can change this in the main directory of pokemmo:
        * PokeMMO/config/main.properties client.graphics.width=765
        * PokeMMO/config/main.properties client.graphics.height=534
